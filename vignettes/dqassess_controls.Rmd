# Package dqassess: methodology

This section provides explanations about methodology and process of checking and controls under the package dqassess.

## Global methodology

## Library installation

For now, all the source of the package are stored on [GitHub](https://github.com/OB7-IRD/dqassess.git). This is web-based hosting service for version control system or tracking changes. First of all, you need to install and load the library in R:

```{r loading_library, eval = FALSE, include = TRUE}
# Devtools is a necessary package
# If is not installed, run the following line
install.packages("devtools")
# Load the package from the Git
devtools::install_git("https://github.com/OB7-IRD/dqassess.git")
# Load the library
library(dqassess)
# You can access to the package documentation with the following line
?dqassess
# If you want the documentation of a specific package function use the same syntax, for example for the function build_template_format_db
?build_template_format_db
```

## Fictive dataset

As example for controls, we use a fictive dataset build to be closer to the RECOLAPE data call. This dataset is stored in the [data](https://github.com/OB7-IRD/dqassess/tree/master/data) directory of the package source and composed of 3 files :

- two excel files, [test_fictive_data1.xlsx](https://github.com/OB7-IRD/dqassess/raw/master/data/test_fictive_data1.xlsx) (containing two sheets named "effort" and "landing") and [test_fictive_data2.xlsx](https://github.com/OB7-IRD/dqassess/raw/master/data/test_fictive_data2.xlsx) (containing one sheet named "sampling").
- one csv file, [test_fictive_data2.csv](https://github.com/OB7-IRD/dqassess/raw/master/data/test_fictive_data2.csv) which is a copy of the excel file test_fictive_data2.xlsx.

Several errors were introduced in the dataset for provide a panel of different output report and explanation for it. Errors are focusing in red color in the two excel files.

The definition data format used was build in according to the data call of the RECOLAPE project (you can find it [here](https://github.com/OB7-IRD/dqassess/raw/master/data/recolape_definition_data_format.xlsx)) For confidential reason we can have a full access of the data of the project, but all of the package was tested under them.

## Checking data

To launch the checking of data, you have to run the following line:

```{r checking_data, eval = FALSE, include = TRUE}

```
